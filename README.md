## Used html2canvas 
Used html2canvas to convert aour meme in png format and store it in our disc.

This project is just a meme creator with some images where you are able to put 2 lines in an image so that you can create a meme and store it as a png file in your disc. It is just to try and comprehend the use of useState in React.
